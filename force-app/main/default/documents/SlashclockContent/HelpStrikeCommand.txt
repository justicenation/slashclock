:information_source: /clock *strike* allows you to delete a time entry from your history. For example, if you clocked in by mistake, the command below will delete the open time entry you just created.

    /clock strike

For more surgical edits to time entries from today or from yesterday, take a look at your history with /clock *entries* and then add the numeric index to delete a specific entry.

    /clock strike 2
    /clock strike 3
    /clock strike 5

Please be careful! After deleting one entry, the indexes _will_ shift. So it's best to check /clock *entries* after each entry is struck to make sure you're targeting the right one.
